# ATMega2560-DC-and-Servo-Motor-Control
Embedded C program for ATMEGA2560 created for CENG447 Lab 8. ATMEGA2560 Takes in analog signals from a potentiometer (POT)  and a photoresister. The controller then uses its on board  timers to create pulse width modulated (PWM) signals to  control the speed of a DC motor and the angle of an angular  servo motor, where the POT controls the motor speed and the  photoresistor controls the servo angle. The motor is equipped with fan blades and is interchangebly referred to as a fan or a DC motor.
